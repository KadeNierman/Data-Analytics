# Data-Analytics

After completing the, Data Analysis with Python course on freecodecamp.org, I completed the first project and have uploaded it here. this project is an automated type of calculator that takes an input of 9 numbers, creates a 3x3  array of those 9 numbers and ouputs the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the columns, rows and the flattened array. 

The prompt I was given to create this project was:
  Create a function named calculate() in mean_var_std.py that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.
  The input of the function should be a list containing 9 digits. The function should convert the list into a 3 x 3 Numpy array, and then return a dictionary containing the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum along both axes and for the flattened matrix.
  If a list containing less than 9 elements is passed into the function, it should raise a ValueError exception with the message: "List must contain nine numbers." The values in the returned dictionary should be lists and not Numpy arrays.


This is my first project I have completed on my own using the knowledge I have learned from the course as well as basic problem solving using google. I am very proud of what I have been able to create and look forward to sharing more of my progress as I continue to move forward with my goal of data analyst.
