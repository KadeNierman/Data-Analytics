# Data-Analytics

After completing the, Data Analysis with Python course on freecodecamp.org, I completed the first project and have uploaded it here. this project is an automated type of calculator that takes an input of 9 numbers, creates a 3x3  array of those 9 numbers and ouputs the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the columns, rows and the flattened array. 

If the input recieved is not equal to 9 numbers the program will raise a ValueError stateing "List must contain nine numbers"
